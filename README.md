# Titanic-Data-Analysis
OVERVIEW:-

This document provides a step-by-step guide on data preprocessing for analyzing the Titanic dataset, covering data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation techniques. Proper preprocessing helps ensure the dataset is suitable for machine learning and statistical analysis, improving the model's accuracy and robustness.

1. Data Understanding and Initial Inspection
The Titanic dataset typically includes the following columns:

Passenger Information: PassengerId, Name, Age, Sex, Ticket, Fare, Embarked
Socio-Economic Data: Pclass (Passenger Class), SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard), Parch (Number of Parents/Children Aboard)
Outcome: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
To start:

Load Data: Import the dataset using pandas or another data analysis library.
Check for Missing Values: Assess which features contain missing values using .isnull() and .sum().
Data Types: Check data types to determine which columns need conversion for numerical or categorical processing.


2. Handling Missing Values
   
2.1 Age Column
Imputation: Since age has missing values, impute these values based on the median or mean of the age column. Alternatively, use the median age per passenger class (Pclass) for a more context-sensitive imputation.
2.2 Embarked Column
Mode Imputation: For missing values in the Embarked column, replace them with the mode (most frequent value) of the column, as it is a categorical variable.
2.3 Fare Column
Median Imputation: Use the median value for missing values in the Fare column, particularly if it is a single missing value or in a column where distribution is skewed.


3. Feature Engineering:-
Feature engineering can enhance the predictive power of a model by creating new variables based on the existing data:

3.1 Creating Family Size
Family Size: Create a new feature, FamilySize, as the sum of SibSp and Parch plus one (the passenger themself). This provides insight into family structure and possible survival correlation.
3.2 Title Extraction
Extract Titles from Name: Extract titles (e.g., Mr., Miss, Mrs.) from the Name column to group passengers by social titles. Map rare titles (like Dr. or Lady) to a single “Other” category to simplify analysis.
3.3 Age Grouping
Categorize Age Groups: Group ages into bins, such as Child, Teenager, Adult, and Senior, to help the model recognize patterns more effectively, especially for decision trees.
3.4 Fare Binning
Fare Bins: Divide the Fare column into categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on quartiles, since fare may reflect social class and access to lifeboats.


4. Encoding Categorical Variables
To use categorical data in models, encode them as numbers:

4.1 Sex Encoding
Binary Encoding: Encode the Sex column as a binary variable (0 for male and 1 for female), which is suitable for most models.
4.2 One-Hot Encoding for Embarked and Pclass
One-Hot Encoding: Convert the Embarked and Pclass columns into one-hot encoded vectors, creating separate columns for each category (e.g., Embarked_C, Embarked_Q, Embarked_S for Embarked and Pclass_1, Pclass_2, Pclass_3 for Pclass).
4.3 Title Encoding
Label Encoding: If titles are extracted, encode them using label encoding, mapping each title to a unique integer.


5. Saving the Preprocessed Dataset
Save the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for reuse and model training:
File Format: Store the preprocessed dataset as a CSV or a binary format (e.g., pickle) to ensure data integrity and faster loading times.


 SUMMARY:-
 
By following these steps, the Titanic dataset will be preprocessed and ready for machine learning models. This structured preprocessing pipeline ensures that missing values are handled, features are engineered for greater predictive power, and categorical data is encoded appropriately, optimizing the dataset for effective model performance.
